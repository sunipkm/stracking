        Properties for each point. Each property should be an array of length N,

    graph : dict {int: list}
        Graph representing associations between tracks. Dictionary defines the
        mapping between a track ID and the parents of the track. This can be
        one (the track has one parent, and the parent has >=1 child) in the
        case of track splitting, or more than one (the track has multiple
        parents, but only one child) in the case of track merging.
        See examples/tracks_3d_with_graph.py
    features: dict {str: dict}
            Properties for each tracks. Each feature should be an map of
            trackID=feature. Ex: features['length'][12]=25.2
    scale : tuple of float
        Scale factors for the image data.
