**STracking** is a python framework to develop particles tracking pipeline. This library has been developed to track
intra-cellular object in microscopy 2D+t and 3D+t images, but can be use to any spots tracking application in 
2D+t and 3D+t images.

A particles tracking pipeline is decomposed into sequential steps. First the particles are **detected** individually and
independently in each time frame of the image. Then a **linker** algorithm is used to link particles between frames and
form the tracks. Then we calculate the **properties** of the particles (size, intensity...) and the **features** of the
tracks (length, distance...) to analyse them. A final step is the tracks **filtering** that uses the properties and 
features to select tracks of interest.


Library components
------------------
The **STracking** library is made of one module per step of the pipeline. Plus one module for data containers:

* **Containers**: ``SParticles`` and ``STracks`` containers based on ``napari`` points and track layer data structures to store particles and tracks
* **Detectors**: define a detector interface and implementations of particle detection algorithm for 2D and 3D image sequences
* **Linkers**: define a linker interface and implementation of particle linkers (or trackers) for 2D and 3D image sequences
* **properties**: define an interface and implementations of algorithms to measure properties of particles (intensity...)
* **feature**: define an interface and implementations of algorithms to measure tracks properties (length, displacement...)
* **filters**: define an interface and implementations of algorithms to select tracks

Containers
~~~~~~~~~~

The containers module has two classes ``SParticles`` and ``STracks`` to facilitate the management of the *particles* and *tracks*
data and metadata. The containers have been designed to be compatible with the napari layers data structures.

A ``SParticles`` object contains a list of particles and there metadata in a 2D+t or 3D+t image. It contains 3 attributes:

    data : array (N, D+1)
        Coordinates for N points in D+1 dimensions. ID,T,(Z),Y,X. The first
        axis is the integer ID of the track. D is either 3 or 4 for planar
        or volumetric time series respectively.
    properties : dict {str: array (N,)}, DataFrame
        Properties for each point. Each property should be an array of length N,
        where N is the number of points.
    scale : tuple of float
        Scale factors for the image data.

A ``STracks`` object contains a list of tracks and there metadata in a 2D+t or 3D+t image. It contains 5 attributes:

    data : array (N, D+1)
        Coordinates for N points in D+1 dimensions. ID,T,(Z),Y,X. The first
        axis is the integer ID of the track. D is either 3 or 4 for planar
        or volumetric time series respectively.
    properties : dict {str: array (N,)}, DataFrame
        Properties for each point. Each property should be an array of length N,
        where N is the number of points.
    graph : dict {int: list}
        Graph representing associations between tracks. Dictionary defines the
        mapping between a track ID and the parents of the track. This can be
        one (the track has one parent, and the parent has >=1 child) in the
        case of track splitting, or more than one (the track has multiple
        parents, but only one child) in the case of track merging.
        See examples/tracks_3d_with_graph.py
    features: dict {str: dict}
            Properties for each tracks. Each feature should be an map of
            trackID=feature. Ex: features['length'][12]=25.2
    scale : tuple of float
        Scale factors for the image data.


Detectors
~~~~~~~~~

``SDetector`` are objects with the same interface. They have a ``run`` method that takes a numpy array ( 2D+t or 3D+t image) as 
an input and returns detections in a ``SParticles`` object. The parameters of the detector have to be passed to it constructor.

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.detectors import DoGDetector
    ...
    detector = DoGDetector(min_sigma=4, max_sigma=5, threshold=0.2)
    particles = detector.run(image)
    ...


Linkers
~~~~~~~

``SLinker`` are objects with the same interface. They have a ``run`` method that takes the detections (in a ``SParticles`` 
object) and optionally a numpy array (the 2D+t or 3D+t image), and return the calculated tracks in a ``STracks`` object.
The parameters of a linker have to be passed in the constructor. For example, the ``SPLinker`` (Shortest Path) linker need a 
cost function, and a frame gap parameters: 

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.linkers import SPLinker, EuclideanCost
    ...
    euclidean_cost = EuclideanCost(max_cost=3000)
    my_tracker = SPLinker(cost=euclidean_cost, gap=1)
    tracks = my_tracker.run(particles)
    ...


Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~

``SProperty`` based objects are objects with the same interface. They have a ``run`` method that takes the detections (in a ``SParticles`` 
object) and a numpy array (the 2D+t or 3D+t image), and returns the input ``SParticles`` where the calculated properties have been added
to the ``SParticles.properties`` dictionary. All the ``SProperty`` parameters have to be send to the constructor. Here is an 
example with the ``IntensityProperty`` algorithm that calculate the `min`, `max`, `mean` and `std` intensities inside the spots using a
given radius:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.properties import IntensityProperty
    ...
    property_calc = IntensityProperty(radius=2)
    property_calc.run(particles, image)
    ...

Features
~~~~~~~~

``SFeature`` based objects are objects with the same interface. They have a ``run`` method that takes the tracks (in a ``STRacks``
object) and optionally a numpy array (the 2D+t or 3D+t image), and returns the input ``STracks`` object where the calculated
features have been added to the ``STracks.features`` dictionary. Here is an example of the ``DistanceFeature`` that calculate
the distance a particle moved:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.filters import DistanceFeature
    ...
    feature_calc = DistanceFeature()
    feature_calc.run(tracks)
    ...

filters
~~~~~~~~

``SFilter`` based objects are objects with the same interface. The have a ``Run`` method that takes the tracks (in a ``STRacks``
object) as input and return the same tracks object where filtered tracks have been removed:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.filters import FeatureFilter
    ...
    filter_calc = FeatureFilter(feature_name='distance', min_val='20', max_val='120')
    filter_calc.run(tracks)



Read and Write
--------------

The **STracking** library provides an extra module called **io**. It allows to read tracks data from many formats (JSON, CSV, 
Icy xml, ISBI xml, TrackMate xml...) and write the tracks in JSON format.
To read a file, you can use the convenient method ``read_tracks`` that takes the path of an input file and return a ``STracks`` 
object:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import read_tracks
    tracks = read_tracks('path/to/the/tracks/file.xml'))

You can also call alternatively call the IO class from the dedicated format. Read tracks are then available in the ``tracks``
attribute of the IO object.

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import TrackMateIO

    reader = TrackMateIO('path/to/the/trackmate/model/file.xml')
    reader.read()
    print(trackmate_reader.stracks)


To write ``STracks`` into a file, the current version of **STracking** only support the *JSON* format from the native 
**stracking** IO class:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import StIO
    ...
    writer = StIO('path/to/the/tracks/file.json')
    writer.write(mytracks)
    ...

a more convenient function is the ``write_tracks`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import write_tracks
    ...
    write_tracks('path/to/the/tracks/file.json', mytracks)
    ...

It is also possible to save the particles in a file. The supported format is a CSV file where each columns is a particle property.
Mandatory properties are 'T', 'Y', 'X' coordinates for 2D+t particles and  'T', 'Z', 'Y', 'X' coordinates for 3D+t particles.
To write particles to file you can use the ``write_particles`` function:
.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import write_particles
    ...
    write_particles('path/to/the/tracks/file.csv', particles)
    ...

And to read particles, the ``read_particles`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.io import read_particles
    ...
    particles read_particles('path/to/the/tracks/file.csv')
    ...



Pipeline
--------   

Writing a tracking pipeline with **STracking** is straightforward. You just need to call the different modules in a sequence:

.. code-block:: python

    from stracking.data import fake_tracks1
    from stracking.detectors import DoGDetector
    from stracking.linkers import SPLinker, EuclideanCost
    from stracking.features import DistanceFeature
    from stracking.filters import FeatureFilter
    from stracking.io import write_tracks

    # Load data
    image = fake_tracks1()

    # detection
    detector = DoGDetector(min_sigma=4, max_sigma=5, threshold=0.2)
    particles = detector.run(image)

    # Linking
    euclidean_cost = EuclideanCost(max_cost=3000)
    my_tracker = SPLinker(cost=euclidean_cost, gap=1)
    tracks = my_tracker.run(particles)

    # Calculate distance feature
    feature_calc = DistanceFeature()
    feature_calc.run(tracks)

    # Keep only tracks that moves less than 60 pixels
    filter_calc = FeatureFilter(feature_name='distance', min_val='20', max_val='60')
    filter_calc.run(tracks)

    # Save the tracks
    write_tracks('path/to/the/tracks/file.json', tracks)
